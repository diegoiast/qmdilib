<p>
	This application demostrates no new functionality, but shows how can you build the code into
	a dynamic library, or set of libraries, and then linking them your application dynamically.
	This is just an example of using the qmake build system.
</p>

<p>
	The source code is exactly the same as in demo2, in fact, the same source files are used,
	with the differenvce that we are linking to a DLL (win32) or *.so (Linux). For more information
	read the qmake documentation, and see the *.pro files in this project.

<h1 style=" display: block; background-color: rgb(166,206,57); ">Static linking vs. Dynamic linking</h1>
<p>
    If you are not sure what is the difference between dynamic linking and static linking, the 
    best way to describe it is: static linking is done one time when compiling the application, which means
    the code is stored inside the binary, and dynamic linking is done each time the application is been run, 
    by the operating system, this means the code is stored in external DLLs or *.so files on Unix/Linux.
</p>

<p>
    If you are linking your libraries statically into the application you you are increasing the final binary file,
    and each time you modify a single file, not only the static library needs to be generated, and the
    binary will need to be linked once again on each single build. 
</p>

<p>
    If you are linking your libraries dynamically, the main application will be smaller, code can be shared
    between several applications which use the same code (library), and when you modify some small source code,
    only one file will be compiled, the library will be regenerated, and you are ready to do. The downside
    is that on Unix/Linux you will need to ovvereide the $LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables for tell the operating
    system where to find the new libraries. On Win32, you can modify the %PATH% or put the DLLs on the same
    directory as the main EXE. A sample shell script it provided in demo4 which shows how to do this. Please 
    note that the application name on Unix/Linux has been modified to *.bin in the project file.
