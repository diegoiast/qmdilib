This is qmdilib 0.0.2.

This is a simple mdi library for Qt 4. The goal of this project, 
is to provide an easy way to modifying menus and toolbars of windows 
on demand. This can be used to present different menus and toolbars to 
widgets inside a QTabWidget, hiding or showing a different set of menus 
on demand or even enabling a small plugin system.

The library is fully documented, and contains some demostrations. It should compile 
flawlessly (no warnings) with a single "qmake; make" on the root directory of the 
project. It is known to work on Windows and Linux, and there is no reason why it 
should not work on other platforms supported by Qt4. Currently only gcc is tested, 
but other compilers should be able to compile this library

The license of this library is LGPL

If you have any questions, please the the HTML manual available at the doc/html directory.
